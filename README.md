> This Playwright-based QA test will goto [Swag Labs](https://saucedemo.com), login, then sort the items **low to high** then verify that the sort is correct.

---

## 🎯 Test Objective

✔️ Navigate through `/inventory`  
✔️ Filter the items low to high  
✔️ Parse the items on the page for the price  
✔️ Confirm that the items have been sorted correctly **from lowest dollar value to highest dollar value**   
✔️ Output validation results via:
- Console summary
- Structured `results-${testInfo.project.name}.json`
- Playwright HTML report

---
